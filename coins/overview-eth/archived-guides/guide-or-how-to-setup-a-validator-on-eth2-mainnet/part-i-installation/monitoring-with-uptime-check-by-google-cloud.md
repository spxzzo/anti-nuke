# Monitoring with Uptime Check by Google Cloud

{% hint style="info" %}
Who watches the watcher? With an external 3rd party tool like Uptime Check, you can have greater reassurance your validator is functioning in case of disasters such as power failure, hardware failure or internet outage. In these scenarios, the previously mentioned monitoring by Prometheus and Grafana would likely cease to function as well.
