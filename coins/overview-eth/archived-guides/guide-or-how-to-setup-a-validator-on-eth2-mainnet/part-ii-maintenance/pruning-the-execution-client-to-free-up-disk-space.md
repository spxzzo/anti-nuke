# Pruning the execution client to free up disk space

## Quick steps guide

{% hint style="info" %}
The following steps align with our [mainnet guide](../../../guide-or-how-to-setup-a-validator-on-eth2-mainnet/). You may need to adjust file names and directory locations where appropriate. The core concepts remain the same.
{% endhint %}

### :dagger: Why do I want to prune my execution client?

* Free up gigs of precious disk space. Typically 200gb or more is common.

### :robot: Pre-requisites

* Works with **geth** currently. **Erigon** and **Besu** prune automatically.
* Ensure at least 50+ GB of free disk space is available otherwise database corruption may occur.

### :construction: How to prune execution client

{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure adequate failover or backup execution clients are configured for use with your beacon-chain node before proceeding. geth is offline and unavailable during this process.
{% endhint %}

1\. Note how much disk space is currently used and stop the execution client

```
df
sudo service eth1 stop
```

2\. Start the pruning process and monitor it's process.

{% hint style="warning" %}
:fire: **Geth pruning Caveats**:

* Pruning can take a few hours or longer (typically 2 to 10 hours is common) depending on your node's disk performance.
* There are three stages to pruning: **iterating state snapshot, pruning state data and compacting database.**
* "**Compacting database**" will stop updating status and appear hung. **Do not interrupt or restart this process.** Typically after an hour, pruning status messages will reappear.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Geth" %}
```bash
/usr/bin/geth snapshot prune-state --datadir $HOME/.ethereum
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

3\. Once the pruning is finished, restart the execution client service.

```bash
sudo service eth1 restart
```

4\. Compare the disk space of the node after pruning.

```bash
df
```

{% hint style="success" %}
Nice work. Enjoy the extra disk breathing room.
