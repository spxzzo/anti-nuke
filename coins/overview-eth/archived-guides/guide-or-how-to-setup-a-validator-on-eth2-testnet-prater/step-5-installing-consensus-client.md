# Step 5: Installing consensus client

## Pick a consensus client

{% hint style="info" %}
To strengthen Ethereum's resilience against potential attacks or consensus bugs, it's best practice to run a minority client in order to increase client diversity. Find the latest distribution of consensus clients here: [https://clientdiversity.org](https://clientdiversity.org/)

:gear: **5.1. Install rust dependency**

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Enter '1' to proceed with the default install.

Update your environment variables.

```bash
echo export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Install rust dependencies.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install -y git gcc g++ make cmake pkg-config libssl-dev libclang-dev clang protobuf-compiler

:bulb: **5.2. Build Lighthouse from source**

```bash
mkdir ~/git
cd ~/git
git clone -b stable https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse.git

```

{% hint style="info" %}
In case of compilation errors, run the following sequence.

```
rustup update

Verify lighthouse was installed properly by checking the version number.

```
lighthouse --version

:tophat: **5.3. Import validator key**

Run the following command to import your validator keys from the staking-deposit-cli tool directory.

Enter your **keystore password** to import accounts.

```bash
lighthouse account validator import --network goerli --reuse-password --directory=$HOME/staking-deposit-cli/validator_keys
```

Verify the accounts were imported successfully.

```bash
lighthouse account_manager validator list --network goerli
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
WARNING: Do not import your validator keys into multiple validator clients and run them at the same time, or you might get slashed. If moving validators to a new setup or different validator client, ensure deletion of the previous validator keys before continuing.

:fire: **5.4. Configure port forwarding and/or firewall**

Specific to your networking setup or cloud provider settings, ensure your validator's firewall ports are open and reachable.

* **Lighthouse consensus client** requires port 9000 for tcp and udp

Take ownership of this directory and set the correct permission level.

```bash
sudo chown ethereum:ethereum /var/lib/nimbus
sudo chmod 700 /var/lib/nimbus

The following command will import your validator keys.

Enter your **keystore password** to import accounts.

```bash
cd $HOME/git/nimbus-eth2
build/nimbus_beacon_node deposits import --data-dir=/var/lib/nimbus $HOME/staking-deposit-cli/validator_keys

:snowboarder: **4.4. Start the beacon chain and validator**

Run the beacon chain automatically with systemd.

***

**ðŸ›  Setup systemd service**

Create a **systemd unit file** to define your`beacon-chain.service` configuration.

```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/beacon-chain.service
```

Paste the following configuration into the file.

```bash
# The eth2 beacon chain service (part of systemd)
# file: /etc/systemd/system/beacon-chain.service

[Unit]
Description=eth2 beacon chain service
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target
Documentation=https://www.coincashew.com

[Service]
Type=simple
User=ethereum
Restart=on-failure
WorkingDirectory=/home/ethereum/git/lodestar
ExecStart=/home/ethereum/git/lodestar/lodestar beacon \
  --network goerli \
  --dataDir /var/lib/lodestar \
  --metrics true \
  --checkpointSyncUrl https://goerli.beaconstate.info \
  --jwt-secret /secrets/jwtsecret \
  --execution.urls http://127.0.0.1:8551 \
  --suggestedFeeRecipient 0x_CHANGE_THIS_TO_MY_ETH_FEE_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

* Replace`0x_CHANGE_THIS_TO_MY_ETH_FEE_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS` with your own Ethereum address that you control. Tips are sent to this address and are immediately spendable, unlike the validator's attestation and block proposal rewards.

To exit and save, press `Ctrl` + `X`, then `Y`, then`Enter`.

Update file permissions.

```bash
sudo chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/beacon-chain.service
```

Run the following to enable auto-start at boot time and then start your beacon node service.

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable beacon-chain
sudo systemctl start beacon-chain
```

{% hint style="success" %}
Nice work. Your beacon chain is now managed by the reliability and robustness of systemd.
{% endhint %}

:dna: **4.5. Start the validator**

## :track\_next: Next Steps

{% hint style="info" %}
Syncing the consensus client is instantaneous with checkpoint sync but the execution client can take up to a day. On nodes with fast NVME drives and gigabit internet, expect your node to be fully synced in a few hours.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Patience required**: If you're checking the logs and see any warnings or errors, please be patient as these will normally resolve once both your execution and consensus clients are fully synced to the Ethereum network.\\

How do I know I'm fully synced?

* Check your execution client's logs and compare the block number against the most recent block on [https://goerli.etherscan.io/](https://goerli.etherscan.io/)
  * Check EL logs: `journalctl -fu eth1`
* Check your consensus client's logs and compare the slot number against the most recent slot on [https://goerli.beaconcha.in](https://goerli.beaconcha.in/)
  * Check CL logs: `journalctl -fu beacon-chain`
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Once your beacon chain is synced, validator up and running, you just wait for activation. This process can take 24+ hours. Only 900 new validators can join per day. When you're assigned, your validator will begin creating and voting on blocks while earning staking rewards.

Use [https://goerli.beaconcha.in](https://goerli.beaconcha.in/) to create alerts and track your validator's performance.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
:tada: Congrats! You've finished the primary steps of setting up your validator. You're now an Ethereum staker!
{% endhint %}

### :thumbsup: Recommended Steps

* Subscribe to your Execution Client and Consensus Client's Github repository to be notified of new releases. Hit the Notifications button.
* Join the [community on Discord and Reddit](../../guide-or-how-to-setup-a-validator-on-eth2-mainnet/joining-the-community-on-discord-and-reddit.md#discord) to discuss all things staking related.
* Familiarize yourself with [Part II - Maintenance](../../guide-or-how-to-setup-a-validator-on-eth2-mainnet/part-ii-maintenance/) section, as you'll need to keep your staking node running at its best.
* Up your staking understanding with the [EthStaker Knowledge Base](https://docs.ethstaker.cc/ethstaker-knowledge-base/)
* **Finished testing?** Before decommissioning your validator, it's good practice to properly [exit your validator](../../guide-or-how-to-setup-a-validator-on-eth2-mainnet/part-iii-tips/voluntary-exiting-a-validator.md) as this improves staking network health.

* Setup [MEV-boost](../../mev-boost/) for extra staking rewards!
* Familiarize yourself with [Part III - Tips](../../guide-or-how-to-setup-a-validator-on-eth2-mainnet/part-iii-tips/) section, as you dive deeper into staking.
