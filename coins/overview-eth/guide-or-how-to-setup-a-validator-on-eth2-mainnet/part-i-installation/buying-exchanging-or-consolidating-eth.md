# :seedling: 1. Buying/exchanging or consolidating ETH

{% hint style="info" %}
Every 32 ETH you own allows you to make 1 validator. You can run thousands of validators with your beacon node.
{% endhint %}

Your ETH (or multiples of 32 ETH) should be consolidated into a single address accessible with Metamask.

If you need to buy/exchange or top up your ETH to a multiple of 32, check out [How to buy ETH guide.](https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-eth/guide-how-to-buy-eth)
