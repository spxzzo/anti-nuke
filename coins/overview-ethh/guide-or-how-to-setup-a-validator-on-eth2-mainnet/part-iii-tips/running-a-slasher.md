# Running a slasher

## :fast\_forward: Quick steps guide

{% hint style="info" %}
The following steps align with our [mainnet guide](./). You may need to adjust file names and directory locations where appropriate. The core concepts remain the same.
{% endhint %}

### :dagger: What is a Slasher?

* Validators might commit slashable transactions such as
  * **Double Voting**: signs more than one block in same epoch
  * **Surround Votes**: signs two contradictory attestations
* A slasher will submit proof of the above offenses into a block proposal.
* Running a slashing helps protect and keeps the network healthy.
* If your slasher successfully detects an offense and is lucky enough to include proof of the offense into your scheduled block proposal, your validator earns extra ETH.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Slashers tend to be resource intensive and is currently recommended for advanced users only.
{% endhint %}

### :robot: Minimum Slasher System Requirements

* Quad-core or more CPU
* 16+ GB RAM
* 256GB+ SSD HD

### :construction: How to Configure the Slasher

Slasher functionality is currently available in Lighthouse or Prysm.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Lighthouse " %}
```bash
# Edit your beacon-chain unit file
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/beacon-chain.service

# Append the following slasher flag to ExecStart
--slasher --debug-level debug

# Example of what your ExecStart could look like.
# lighthouse bn --staking --metrics --network mainnet --slasher --debug-level debug

# Reload the new unit file
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Restart your beacon-chain
sudo systemctl restart beacon-chain
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Prysm" %}
```bash
# Revamped Prysm slasher implementation. 
# The slasher functionality is no longer a standalone binary. 
# Note: Running the slasher has considerably increased resource requirements. 
# Be sure to review the latest documentation before enabling this feature. 

# Edit your beacon-chain unit file
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/beacon-chain.service

# Append the following slasher flag to ExecStart
--slasher

# Example of what your ExecStart could look like.
# prysm.sh beacon-chain --slasher

# Reload the new unit file
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Restart your beacon-chain
sudo systemctl restart beacon-chain
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
