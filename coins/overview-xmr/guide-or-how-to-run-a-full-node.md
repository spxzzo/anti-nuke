# Guide | How to run your own Monero node

## â€‹ðŸ—¡ Why should I run my own Monero node?

* To independently have the ability to send/receive/verify transactions while maintaining the highest privacy and security, you will want to run your own node.
* If you do not run your own node, you are relying on other's nodes to verify and send your transactions.
* To contribute to the decentralization of the Monero network.
* To use a monero wallet requires connecting to a fully synched node. Best node is your own.
* To connect to the monero network, you run a peer-to-peer application called **monerod** (the d stands for daemon) and it forms the backbone of the Monero network.
* **Optional**: Offering your node as a public remote note is to volunteer your node as a public resource by helping onboard new monero nodes and relay other monero users transactions.

{% hint style="info" %}
Monero nodes come in two flavours.

* **Full Node**: Stores all blockchain data
* **Pruned Node**: Stores a random 1/8th of the blockchain's data and requires much less disk space
{% endhint %}

### â€‹ :rocket:Minimum Full Node System Requirements <a href="#minimum-slasher-system-requirements" id="minimum-slasher-system-requirements"></a>

* Dual-core CPU
* 4+ GB RAM
* 160GB+ SSD HD

### :robot: Minimum Pruned Node System Requirements <a href="#minimum-slasher-system-requirements" id="minimum-slasher-system-requirements"></a>

* Same as full node yet with a smaller HD
* 80GB+ SSD HD

{% hint style="info" %}
As of early 2021, a pruned node uses 32GB and a full node uses 96GB of storage space.
{% endhint %}

## :bricks: 1. Configuring ports and firewall

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/xmrports.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
**Recommendation**: the **Public Full Node** with **port 18089**, a restricted RPC port, is the best option to support the Monero network while allowing yourself and others to use it as a remote node for wallets. Following intructions in this guide, you will implement a monero node in this configuration. Adjust ports accordingly if you want more restricted behavior.
{% endhint %}

```bash
# By default, deny all incoming and outgoing traffic
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
# Allow ssh access
sudo ufw allow ssh
# Allow monerod p2p port
sudo ufw allow 18080
# Allow monerod restricted RPC port
sudo ufw allow 18089
# Enable firewall
sudo ufw enable
```

```bash
# Verify status
sudo ufw status numbered
```

Setup service accounts.

```bash
# creates system user account for monero service
sudo adduser --system --no-create-home --user-group monero
```

Create some folders the service needs & set their ownership:

```bash
# logfile goes here
sudo mkdir /var/log/monero

# blockchain database goes here
sudo mkdir /var/lib/monero

# create file for config  
sudo touch /var/lib/monero/monerod.conf

# set permissions to service account
sudo chown -R monero:monero /var/lib/monero
sudo chown -R monero:monero /var/log/monero
```

Download the latest monero node binaries.

```bash
cd $HOME
wget --content-disposition https://downloads.getmonero.org/cli/linux64
```

Verify the download hash signature.

```bash
#download latest hashes.txt file
wget https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/hashes.txt

#search hashes.txt file for the computed sha256sum
grep -e $(sha256sum monero-linux-x64-*.tar.bz2) hashes.txt
```

A match appears and this confirms the file is valid.

Example output:

> hashes.txt:b566652c5281970c6137c27dd15002fe6d4c9230bc37d81545b2f36c16e7d476 monero-linux-x64-v0.17.1.8.tar.bz2

Extract tar and copy to /usr/local/bin

```bash
tar -xvf monero-linux-x64-*.tar.bz2
sudo mv monero-x86_64-linux-gnu-*/* /usr/local/bin
sudo chown -R monero:monero /usr/local/bin/monero*
```

Cleanup files.

```bash
rm monero-linux-x64-*.tar.bz2
rm hashes.txt
rm -rf monero-x86_64-linux-gnu-*/
```

Configure your Monero Node with a config file.

```bash
sudo nano /var/lib/monero/monerod.conf
```

Add this to the file.

```bash
#blockchain data / log locations
data-dir=/var/lib/monero
log-file=/var/log/monero/monero.log

#log options
log-level=0
max-log-file-size=0 # Prevent monerod from managing the log files; we want logrotate to take care of that

# P2P full node
p2p-bind-ip=0.0.0.0 # Bind to all interfaces (the default)
p2p-bind-port=18080 # Bind to default port
public-node=true # Advertises the RPC-restricted port over p2p peer lists

# rpc settings
rpc-restricted-bind-ip=0.0.0.0
rpc-restricted-bind-port=18089

# i2p settings
tx-proxy=i2p,127.0.0.1:8060

# node settings
prune-blockchain=true
db-sync-mode=safe # Slow but reliable db writes
enforce-dns-checkpointing=true
enable-dns-blocklist=true # Block known-malicious nodes
no-igd=true # Disable UPnP port mapping
no-zmq=true # ZMQ configuration

# bandwidth settings
out-peers=32 # This will enable much faster sync and tx awareness; the default 8 is suboptimal nowadays
in-peers=32 # The default is unlimited; we prefer to put a cap on this
limit-rate-up=1048576 # 1048576 kB/s == 1GB/s; a raise from default 2048 kB/s; contribute more to p2p network
limit-rate-down=1048576 # 1048576 kB/s == 1GB/s; a raise from default 8192 kB/s; allow for faster initial sync
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Configuration File Comments**

* Modify `prune-blockchain` to `false` if you want to store full blockchain
* Modify `public-node` to `false` if you do not want other users to use your node.
* `rpc-restricted-bind-ip/port flags`enable restricted access to your node but allow full RPC from other Monero wallets on your LAN.
* Limit the upload speed in case you have a data cap: `limit-rate-up=8192` (in kB/s). Conversely, if you have an unlimited data plan, consider increasing the upload speeds to better support the Monero network. A node can typically use up to 1TB traffic per month.
{% endhint %}

Create a `monerod.service` systemd unit file. Simply copy and paste the following.

```bash
cat > $HOME/monerod.service << EOF
[Unit]
Description=monerod
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=forking
PIDFile=/var/lib/monero/monerod.pid
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/monerod --config-file /var/lib/monero/monerod.conf --detach --pidfile /var/lib/monero/monerod.pid
User=monero
Group=monero
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

Move the file to `/etc/systemd/system/monerod.service`

```bash
sudo mv $HOME/monerod.service /etc/systemd/system/monerod.service
```

Restart monerod in order for config change to take effect.

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable monerod
sudo systemctl restart monerod
```

Check the systemd service with

```
journalctl -fu monerod
```

Review the logs for any errors. CTRL + C to exit.

```
tail -f /var/log/monero/monero.log
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Allow the node to sync. This may take a few hours up to a few days depending on your node's system resources.
{% endhint %}

Your node is completely synchronized the node status says **height:** **n / n** **100%** and has the same **block height** as a public xmr block explorer such as [https://blockchair.com/monero](https://blockchair.com/monero) or [http://xmrchain.net/](http://xmrchain.net/)

Check your node's block height with the following command.

```bash
monerod status
```

{% hint style="success" %}
Connect to your brand new node with your favorite clients such as Monerujo, CakeWallet or Monero-GUI. Simply enter your node's IP or hostname into the remote node field. Congrats! :confetti\_ball:
{% endhint %}

## :pick: Optional: Start mining

Like winning a lotto ticket, your monero node has a chance to mine a block. You may never win a block but your hashrate helps protect and strengthen the network.

Start with 1 thread, check your mining hashrate and increase if your CPU resources allow.

Run the following command.

```bash
monerod start_mining <YOUR XMR ADDRESS> <NUMBER OF THREADS>
```

## :flying\_saucer: Optional: Setup I2P

Download I2p.

```bash
wget https://github.com/i2p-zero/i2p-zero/releases/download/v1.20/i2p-zero-linux.v1.20.zip
unzip i2p-zero-linux.v1.20
sudo cp -r i2p-zero-linux.v1.20/* /usr/local/bin

sudo chown -R i2p:i2p /usr/local/bin/router

rm i2p-zero-linux.v1.20.zip
rm -rf i2p-zero-linux.v1.20
```

Setup service accounts.

```bash
# creates system user account for i2p service
sudo adduser --system --group --no-create-home i2p
```

Create a `i2pzero.service` systemd unit file. Simply copy and paste the following.

```bash
cat > $HOME/i2pzero.service << EOF
[Unit]
Description=i2pzero
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=i2p
Group=i2p
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/router/bin/i2p-zero
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

Move the file to `/etc/systemd/system/i2pzero.service`

```bash
sudo mv $HOME/i2pzero.service /etc/systemd/system/i2pzero.service
```

Check the logs.

```
journalctl -fu i2pzero
```

Restart i2pzero in order for config change to take effect.

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable i2pzero
sudo systemctl start i2pzero
sudo systemctl status i2pzero
```

Based on the status, open the port \<NUMBER> on your firewall for best performance.

> For best performance, please open port \<NUMBER> on your firewall for incoming UDP and TCP connections. This port has been randomly assigned to you. For privacy reasons, please do not share this port with others.

```bash
cd $HOME/i2p-zero-linux
INBOUND_I2P=$(router/bin/tunnel-control.sh server.create 127.0.0.1 8061)
echo INBOUND I2P: $INBOUND_I2P
router/bin/tunnel-control.sh socks.create 8060
```

Append the following to your monerod config file.

```bash
sudo nano /var/lib/monero/monerod.conf

tx-proxy=i2p,127.0.0.1:8060
anonymous-inbound=<Your INBOUND_I2P>,127.0.0.1:8061 
```

Open the i2p port.

```bash
# i2p port
sudo ufw allow 8060
```

Restart monerod.

```
sudo systemctl restart monerod
```
