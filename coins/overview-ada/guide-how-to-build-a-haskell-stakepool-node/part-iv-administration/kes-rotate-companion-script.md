Every Cardano Pool Operator has to generate a new KES key pair and Operational Certificate every 90 days. A full guide is available here. In order to help Pool Operators during the process, a Companion Script is available in addition to the guide linked above.

## What the Companion Script does

* Checks KES period and counter on chain
* Reminds user about the good practice and counter cases
* Asks user if he wants to backup current KES keys and NODE cert
* Asks user if he wants to rotate KES keys
* Calculates Starting KES Period
* Provides next-steps to generate new OP cert on air-gapped machine

## How to use Companion Script

### Download the Script

The script can be found on this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Kirael12/Cardano-KES-Rotate-Companion/) by [\[FRADA\] ADA Made In France](https://cardano-france-stakepool.org)

```bash
cd $HOME/git
git clone https://github.com/Kirael12/Cardano-KES-Rotate-Companion/
```

### Make script executable

```bash
cd $HOME/git/Cardano-KES-Rotate-Companion/
chmod +x rotateKES.sh
```

### Run the script

```bash
sudo -E ./rotateKES.sh
```

**1. Script will ask if you want to backup current KES Keys and OP certificate**

If you answer yes :

* 3 files kes.vkey.bak, kes.skey.bak and node.cert.bak will be created in your $NODE\_HOME directory
* Previous backup will be deleted

If you answer no :

* No backup will be created

**2. Script will ask if you want to generate a new KES key pair**

If you answer yes :

* 2 files will be created : kes.skey and kes.key. Those are your new KES key pair

If you answer no :

* No new KES key pair will be generated and the script will stop

**3. Script will calculate for your the KES starting period**

**4. Script will then provide you with the next steps and the cardano-cli command to execute on your Air-Gapped machine**

* The command includes the KES starting period you need to use.
